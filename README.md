# Hindi-Handwritten-Character-Recognition
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten Hindi (Devanagari) characters using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Since the dataset was very large, it could not be uploaded to GitHub and is instead provided through a Google Drive link.

Dataset Information
Original Dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Devanagari+Handwritten+Character+Dataset
The dataset was originally stored in a directory structure. After downloading it locally, the images were converted into CSV files for easier processing. These CSV files have been uploaded to Google Drive.
